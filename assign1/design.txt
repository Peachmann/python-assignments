# Caesar Cipher
I created a 3-rotated alphabet with an iterator and matched the letters.
For deciphering, same but reversed.

# Vigenere Cipher
I looped the keyword with cycle iterator and calculated values with ord and char, respectively.

# Scytale
Get i-th char, make it a string list and join them.
Reverse this method for deciphering.

# Railfence
Store text in a matrix as shown. Concatenate every line to get cipher.
Create a matrix with the reversed method, transpose it to get the plaintext.

# Byte-Caesar
Same as normal Caesar, but with mod 256 (text is read as bytearray).
